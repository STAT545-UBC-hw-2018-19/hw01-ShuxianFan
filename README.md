## About The Repository

This is an exploratory repository of ShuxianFan [@ShuxianFan](https://github.com/ShuxianFan) for the course STAT545A in UBC as an exercise to elaborate and test out different features of Markdown Text. 

Here you will find:
  
  :memo: A [**README**](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw01-ShuxianFan/blob/master/README.md) file that contains the basic information of the repository and some [**fun facts**](#fun-facts-about-myself) about me!
  
  :bar_chart: An R_Markdown document that presents some interesting exploratory data analysis on the Gapminder dataset.


## Fun Facts about Myself
### :smile_cat: Name 
I love my hard-to-pronounce name: Shuxian Fan. (give it a try - shoe she-Ann fan) 
My parents gave me this name with their best wishes as the Chinese Characters *Shu* and *Xian* means 
> “good, pure, virtuous, charming”. 

I also go by Trinity and yes it comes from the movie [*The Matrix*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix). :joy: 

### :smirk_cat: Major
I studied in Financial Mathematics before I decided to transfer to UBC to change my major three years ago. Statistics was my second choice but it turns out to be the passion I found.
